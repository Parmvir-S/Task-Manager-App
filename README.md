## Purpose

The Task Manager API is a backend project that allows users to manage tasks using a RESTful API. It was built using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB as a way to explore these technologies and learn how to create a backend API.

## Features

The Task Manager API includes the following features:

-   User registration: Users can register for an account and create a new user profile.
-   User login: Users can login to their account using their email and password.
-   User logout: Users can logout of their account.
-   User logout of all instances: Users can logout of all instances of their account.
-   Task creation: Users can create new tasks and add them to their task list.
-   Task update: Users can update the details of their tasks as needed.
-   Task reading: Users can read their tasks and view the details of each one.
-   Task deletion: Users can delete tasks from their task list.
-   User update: Users can update their user profile information.
-   User deletion: Users can delete their user account.
-   Task reading (all tasks): Users can read all of the tasks in their task list.
-   Task reading (single task): Users can read a single task in their task list.
-   User profile viewing: Users can view their own user profile.

## Tech Stack

The Task Manager API was built using the following technologies:

-   Express: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of creating a backend API
-   Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable network applications
-   MongoDB: A cross-platform document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents
-   Mongoose: An object modeling tool for MongoDB that simplifies database queries and helps to structure data

## Motivation

The main motivation behind the development of the Task Manager API was to create a backend project that would allow users to manage tasks using a RESTful API. This project was also an opportunity to explore new technologies and learn how to create a backend API using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.


## Challenges

One issue that I encountered while building the Task Manager API was the challenge of integrating MongoDB and Mongoose into the project. Ensuring that the database is properly connected and that the data is being stored and retrieved correctly can be complex, especially for those who are new to these technologies.

## Potential Accomplishments

By building the Task Manager API, I achieved a number of accomplishments, including:

-   Gaining experience with backend development and improving my skills in web development and server-side programming
-   Creating a functional API that allows users to manage tasks using RESTful routes
-   Exploring new technologies such as Express, Node.js, and MongoDB

## Future Changes

There are a number of things that could be done to improve the Task Manager API in the future. One potential change is to implement a frontend for the API, allowing users to interact with the API and manage their tasks through a user interface rather than just through API requests. This could involve creating a web application or a mobile application using a frontend framework such as React or Angular. Other potential improvements could include adding more features to the API, such as the ability to assign tasks to certain app users.
